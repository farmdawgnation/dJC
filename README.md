# dJC: The dAmn Java Client

This is an old project I wrote back in 2005. I made a minor update in 2007, but it's been pretty much untouched since
then. The coding style is pretty abysmal and there are some aspects of it that I can only attribute to the fact that
it's a Java project. I moved it here more out of a sense of nastolgia and to get it out of the CVS version control it
was bound to in the event someone else wanted to improve it.
